**TL;DR:** FarSight is a Linux-based system that applies deep learning to far-memory prefetching, reducing high-latency memory access through accurate, low-overhead predictions. It decouples memory layout from application behavior, allowing offline-trained deep learning models to make efficient runtime decisions using lightweight mapping. Across data-intensive workloads, FarSight outperforms state-of-the-art systems by up to **3.6×**, proving deep learning's practicality for performance-critical runtime optimization. FarSight research paper can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00384).

## The Far Memory Problem

Far memory architectures use cheaper, network-attached memory, but accessing it is slow.
This latency is a major bottleneck.
Prefetching—predicting and fetching data before it's needed—is the solution,
but traditional methods fail when access patterns get complex.

## The FarSight Solution: Decoupling

FarSight's core innovation is to separate **what** to prefetch from **where** it is in memory.
A Deep Learning model predicts the access pattern's logic,
and a lightweight runtime structure called a "<em>**Future Map**</em>"
translates that logic into actual memory addresses.

## How It Works: A Deep Dive

FarSight combines several techniques to make its prediction framework efficient and effective. Explore the key components below.

## Performance Deep Dive

FarSight was evaluated against two state-of-the-art systems
([FastSwap](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3342195.3387522) and
[Hermit](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/qiao)) on four data-intensive workloads.
Select a workload to see how FarSight performed across different local memory constraints.

## Key Contributions
This work demonstrates the viability of applying modern ML to solve complex systems problems and introduces several key ideas:
- The first ML-based prefetching system for far memory fully implemented in the Linux kernel.
- The novel idea of decoupling memory-access semantics from runtime address layouts.
- The introduction and efficient management of "Future Maps" as a core data structure for runtime address resolution.
- A full suite of optimizations (asynchronous I/O, lookahead, etc.) to ensure low overhead and high performance.
